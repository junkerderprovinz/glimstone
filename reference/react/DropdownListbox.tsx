// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DropdownListbox — the shared `role="listbox"` panel every button-opens-a-
// list picker in this app drops open, PORTALLED to document.body and
// positioned off its trigger's own live rect.
//
// Bug this exists to fix (jdp, live review, Containers tab): "Wenn ich die
// Dropdownliste für 'Andere Container stoppen' öffne, wird sie abgeschnitten,
// weil sie nur bis zum unteren Ende der Card eingeblendet wird. Sie soll über
// die Card hinausgehen und voll angezeigt werden."
//   Root cause was NOT z-index. Both listboxes in this app (Containers.tsx's
// StopContainersEditor multi-select and Settings.tsx's LanguageCard) rendered
// their panel as an ordinary `absolute start-0 top-full … z-50` child of the
// trigger's own `relative` wrapper. ContainerRow's card — the wrapper that
// ends up being an ANCESTOR of the Containers one — is `relative
// overflow-hidden` (it needs that: ProgressBar.tsx renders as `absolute
// bottom-0 start-0 end-0 h-1` with square ends and is documented to require a
// `relative overflow-hidden` card so the bar gets clipped to the card's own
// rounded bottom corners; the `.glim-tint` wash and the row's rounded corners
// ride on the same clip). `overflow: hidden` clips absolutely-positioned
// DESCENDANTS whatever their z-index — z-50 could never have escaped it, so
// the panel physically stopped at the card's bottom edge.
//   The fix is the one this codebase already uses for every other floating
// surface: render through a portal so no ancestor's overflow can reach it
// (InfoBubble.tsx, IconTipButton.tsx, ColorPickerPopover.tsx, TimePicker.tsx),
// and position it with lib/bubblePosition.ts's shared computeBubblePosition —
// the same helper TimePicker/InfoBubble/IconTipButton call, so viewport
// clamping and the flip-above-the-trigger fallback come for free instead of
// being re-derived here.
//
// Structural reference is TimePicker.tsx, the closest existing sibling: same
// portal + measure-then-position useLayoutEffect, same dismissal set (outside
// mousedown, Escape, scroll, resize), and critically the same
// scroll-from-INSIDE-the-panel guard — this panel is itself scrollable
// (`max-h-60 overflow-y-auto`), so a naive capture-phase `window` scroll
// listener would close the list the moment a user scrolled it.
//
// The panel is sized to its TRIGGER's measured width, and centred on the
// trigger via `translateX(-50%)`, because computeBubblePosition's contract is
// "here is where the CENTRE goes" (see .glim-time-popover's own CSS comment
// for why that pairing has to be honoured exactly). Equal widths make centred
// and start-aligned identical, so this keeps the pre-portal look — while also
// making RTL correct for free (no `start-0`/`end-0` branch at all) and
// keeping a `w-64 max-w-full` trigger that got squeezed by a narrow card from
// popping open a visibly wider list than the button that opened it.

  // `hueVars(rainbowAt(index))` on the row card — stop reaching it entirely.
  // Before the portal, this listbox's option checkboxes (`accentColor:
  // var(--accent)`) painted in THEIR ROW'S rainbow position; portalling
  // without this would have silently dropped them back to the single global
  // accent, which is exactly the regression that rule exists to prevent.
  //   Copied off the trigger's own *resolved* computed style rather than
  // taken as a prop, so it needs nothing from the call sites and keeps
  // working for any future one: whatever hue the trigger stands in, the panel
  // it opens stands in too. `.glim-hue` is added alongside so index.css's own
  // `[data-rainbow] .glim-hue` / `[data-rainbow="reactive"] .glim-hue:hover`
  // rules do the actual --accent derivation, in every rainbow mode, instead
  // of this component hard-coding one mode's answer. With rainbow off there
  // are no --item-hue* values to copy, `hue` stays empty, and the panel keeps
  // the global accent exactly as before.
  //   The implementation moved to lib/portalHue.ts in [543], unchanged in
  // behaviour: FolderBrowser's dialog needed the identical thing and had gone
  // without it since [478] portalled it, so the second occurrence became a
