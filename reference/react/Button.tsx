// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Button — the one clickable control (#178).
//
// Naming, jdp's own (2026-08-28): something you can CLICK is a button,
// something you only read is a badge. That is also what HTML and assistive
// technology require, so the split is not cosmetic: a clickable thing has to
// be a real <button> or it cannot be reached by keyboard.
//
// This component owns four things a call site should never repeat:
//
//   1. WHAT IS SHOWN — text, text with glyph, or glyph alone, from the shared
//      "buttons" axis. One setting for the whole app, not a prop per site.
//   2. HOW WIDE IT IS — a stage derived from the LABEL, so the width is the
//      same in all three modes and switching mode never reflows the page.
//      This is jdp's explicit requirement; the width therefore cannot come
//      from what is currently visible, because a lone glyph is narrow.
//   3. THAT IT STAYS READABLE — in glyph mode the label is visually hidden but
//      still in the accessible tree (`sr-only`), and it becomes the tooltip.
//      Nothing here can produce a button whose purpose is unlabelled.
//      That tooltip is the app's REAL `.glim-bubble` (lib/useTipBubble.tsx),
//      never the native `title=` balloon — jdp's ruling on the contradiction
//      glyph mode created. design-language.md calls a native title on an
//      icon-only control the anti-pattern IconTipButton exists to replace,
//      and lint-rules/icon-badge-needs-tooltip.js fails the build over it;
//      glyph mode would otherwise have committed that anti-pattern 171 times
//      in one setting, where before it was a handful of deliberate spots.
//      The choice was to weaken the rule or to make this component honour it.
//      It honours it — and while the bubble was being wired in, the native
//      balloon left this component entirely, so a button's `title` is now
//      shown the same way in every mode instead of switching mechanism when
//      the text disappears.
//   4. ITS COLOUR-ENGINE POSITION — `hueIndex` works exactly as it does on
//      Badge, because rainbow mode is a standing, app-wide rule: a control
//      that opts out of it is a bug, not a simplification.
//
// A glyph is optional for now. Only 17 of the app's 163 buttons carry one
// today, and jdp wants all of them to get one; until a given button has its
// glyph, glyph mode falls back to showing that button's text, which is the one
// failure mode worth having (a slightly inconsistent strip beats a row of
// blank squares nobody can identify).
