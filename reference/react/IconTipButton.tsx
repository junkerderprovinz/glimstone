// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IconTipButton — a plain icon-only <button> whose accessible name AND its
// only hover/focus explanation is a real `.glim-bubble` tooltip, not the OS's
// own native `title=` balloon.
//
// Root cause (jdp, live-review: "beim Ordnersymbol ist die Hover-Infobubble
// nicht im GlimStone"): FolderBrowser's own "Durchsuchen" icon button carried
// only `title=`/`aria-label=` — the browser's own plain OS balloon, visibly
// disagreeing with PathModeSwitch's Local/Remote icon pair sitting right next
// to it, which already got the real `.glim-bubble` treatment in an earlier
// round. `tip` is REQUIRED here, not optional: design-language.md's own
// tooltip section is explicit that "an icon-only button (no visible text at
// all) needs one unconditionally — there's no other way to know what it does."
//
// This file used to carry its own copy of the open-state / measure-then-clamp
// / close-on-scroll-or-Escape machinery — the THIRD of four identical copies
// in this app. That machinery now lives in lib/useTipBubble.tsx and this file
// is what remained once it left: a button element, a `tip` that is also its
// accessible name, and the two ARIA state props below. See the hook's own
// header for why the four copies had to become one.
//
// What is left here that Button.tsx does NOT do — i.e. why this component
// still exists as its own thing now that Button has grown the same bubble:
// this is the control with NO label to hide. A bare glyph in a caller-sized
// box (`h-8 w-8`, `size-7`), taking no width stage, no tone fill and no place
// in the label-mode engine, because there is no text for a mode to show or
// hide. Button is a labelled action that CAN be shown as a glyph; this is a
// glyph that never had words in the first place.
