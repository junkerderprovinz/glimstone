// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Badge — the one shared status chip/pill (GlimStone form-engine Task 5).
//
// Replaces five previously-separate copies of the same "colored chip" markup:
// Dashboard.tsx's StatusChip, components/SpikePanel.tsx's own byte-different
// duplicate StatusChip (which also hard-coded untranslated English
// "OK"/"FAIL"/"INFO" — fixed at ITS call site via the spike.ok/spike.fail/
// spike.info i18n keys, not inside Badge, since status TEXT is domain content
// Badge has no business owning), Receiver.tsx's Badge, Fleet.tsx's byte-
// identical duplicate of it, and Containers.tsx/VMs.tsx's StateChip pair.
//
// Badge only knows how to paint a fixed-size, fixed-shape, fixed-color chip.
// Mapping a domain status/state string to a `tone` stays call-site logic (a
// few lines of local switch/lookup) — the same separation Toggle.tsx draws
// between "how a switch renders" and "what a caller's label says".
//
// Sizing started as three named stages (small/medium/large per the design
// language's "however many an app genuinely needs — small/medium/large is
// usually enough"), briefly grew to six (heading/icon/field/compact), and is
// now back to FIVE: small/medium/large/heading for text chips, plus exactly
// ONE stage — `icon` — for every square icon-only badge in the app. See the
// "ONE SIZE FOR SQUARE ICON BADGES" block further down for why the three-way
// icon/compact/field split was removed and must not come back. Each stage
// pins height + horizontal padding + font-size together as one canonical
// source, read verbatim from the stage table below rather than left for a
// call site to repeat as its own literals — that repetition is exactly how
// the five duplicates this file replaces drifted apart in the first place
// (px-2/px-1.5/no-size-class/text-[10px] all coexisting for what was
// supposed to be one visual weight).
//   - small  = 18px tall, 11px text  (--text-caption) — the OffsiteTargets-
//     Section storage-class/immutable weight, previously the "no size class"
//     bug (padding with no font-size utility of its own, height at the mercy
//     of whatever the parent's ambient font-size happened to be).
//   - medium = 20px tall, 12px text (--text-dense) — the dominant weight
//     used by every StatusChip/Badge/StateChip predecessor.
//   - large  = 24px tall, 12px text (--text-dense) — the ErrorDetailPanel
//     count-badge + "Resolve"-button weight (see `as="button"` below).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ONE SIZE FOR SQUARE ICON BADGES — 32px (`size="icon"`, h-8/w-8). Full stop.
//
// Every square icon-only badge in this app renders at 32×32. There is no
// second size, no per-role size, no "but this one sits somewhere different"
// exception. If you are adding a square icon-only badge, pass `size="icon"`
// and stop thinking about it.
//
// A ROLE-BASED SPLIT WAS TRIED AND EXPLICITLY REJECTED — do not reintroduce
// it. A previous round audited every icon-badge call site, grouped them by
// ROLE, live-measured each role against its own nearest neighbour, and
// concluded the app legitimately had three sizes:
//   - 28px (`icon`)    "standalone corner-badge pair"       → BackupButton,
//                                                             ExportButton
//   - 32px (`compact`) "icon badge beside a 32px field"     → FolderBrowser,
//                                                             SourceToggle, …
//   - 24px (`large`)   "badge in a dense list row"          → RestorePanel's
//                                                             restore + delete
// Each role WAS internally consistent, and every individual measurement in
// that audit was correct. It was still the wrong answer, because the roles
// are not visually separated: all three appear SIMULTANEOUSLY inside a single
// expanded Container card. Measured live on the real deployed container, one
// card at once showed "Jetzt sichern" 28×28, "Export" 28×28, "Lokal" 32×32,
// "Offsite" 32×32, "Wiederherstellen" 24×24, "Löschen" 24×24 — three
// different badge sizes side by side, which is exactly what jdp reported,
// twice: "es gibt drei verschiedene Größen von quadratischen Badges. Bitte
// alle gleich groß!"
//
// The lesson, stated plainly so it doesn't have to be relearned: "internally
// consistent per role" is not a property a USER can perceive. A user sees one
// card. Roles are an authoring-side abstraction; identical size is the
// user-side contract. A justification of the form "these two badges may
// differ because they play different roles" is, by itself, evidence the split
// is wrong — not a reason it is allowed.
//
// WHY 32px specifically (measured live, not chosen for tidiness):
//   - It is the height of this app's dominant real text input. FolderBrowser's
//     path field (`text-sm px-3 py-1.5`) measures exactly 32px, and its
//     "Durchsuchen" badge sits on the same `items-center` row: both boxes'
//     top edges measured identical to the pixel. Settings' Registry fields are
//     the same recipe. A badge next to a field must align with that field, and
//     32px is the only value that does so without touching the field.
//   - It is already the app's most common icon-badge size by call-site count,
//     including every Selector `iconOnly` segment (Selector.tsx's own h-8 w-8
//     — SourceToggle's Lokal/Offsite pair and PathModeSwitch's Local/Remote
//     pair, 8 call sites), FolderBrowser's browse badge, Settings' Registry
//     add/remove, VMSSHCard's two copy badges, the widget-URL copy badge and
//     the Recovery-Kit download badge. Standardising on 32px changes the
//     fewest pixels and leaves every already-correct field alignment intact.
//   - The competing candidates both FAIL the field-alignment test: 24px and
//     28px would each sit visibly short next to a 32px input, and adopting
//     either would have meant re-sizing Selector plus a dozen non-Badge
//     controls to chase a number nothing else in the app uses.
//   - The dense-list objection is real but small and was paid for directly:
//     RestorePanel's and Config's snapshot rows were `py-2.5` around 24px
//     content (44px rows). Their padding is now `py-1.5` around 32px content,
//     so those rows measure the SAME 44px they always did — a bigger badge in
//     an unchanged-density list, rather than a list that grew.
//   - The 36px off-site repo-url input (`px-3 py-2 text-sm`) keeps its own
//     height; its badges are 32px and centre against it. A 4px difference
//     between a badge and one taller-than-usual field is invisible next to
//     the defect being fixed (three badge sizes in one card), and "match this
//     one field exactly" is precisely the per-role reasoning that produced
//     the defect.
//
// KNOCK-ON, deliberately included so the rule doesn't break something else:
// the Appearance tab's colour swatches moved 28px → 32px (PaletteSwatch,
// AccentPresetSwatch, and the custom-accent swatch, which was a stray 24px)
// so the two reset badges in those rows still sit flush with the swatches
// they reset — an alignment jdp has already reported twice ("der Reset-Badge
// ist größer als die Farbfelder"). Swatches are colour discs, not icon
// badges, so they are free to follow the badge rather than the other way
// round.
//
// NOT square icon badges, and deliberately untouched: InfoBubble's inline
// 15px info glyph (a text-flow annotation with no badge chrome) and the
// backup-order list's bare `p-1` reorder arrows (20px, no resting fill, no
// tooltip bubble — a drag-list affordance, not a tile). Neither carries a
// badge background at rest; if either is ever converted INTO a badge, it
// takes 32px like everything else.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `as="button"` renders a real <button> instead of a <span> but resolves to
// the EXACT SAME box at a given stage: same height, same padding, same font,
// same radius. A native button brings its own default padding/border/font
// that a <span> never had, so this is spelled out explicitly rather than
// left to whatever the element normally defaults to — `appearance-none`
// strips native button chrome, `box-border` fixes box-sizing so the
// declared height isn't inflated by border/padding math, and `min-h-0`
// blocks a stretch-alignment flex/grid parent from growing the box taller
// than the stage's own height. This is what actually fixes the
// ErrorDetailPanel span-vs-button height mismatch: both render through this
// one component at the same stage, so nothing downstream can drift them
// apart independently again.
//
// `as="a"` (Task 5, rule 13 — "everything clickable is a badge, including
// links") renders a real <a href> instead of onClick-on-a-span: a plain-text
// link still needs native anchor behaviour (right-click "copy link address",
// middle-click/ctrl-click to open in a new tab, the status-bar URL preview,
// screen-reader "link" role vs. "button" role) that a synthetic onClick
// handler degrades. `href`/`target`/`rel` are only meaningful with `as="a"`
// and pass straight through. Resolves to the identical box as span/button at
// the same stage — see `badgeClassName` below, which all three branches
// share so nothing can drift them apart independently.
//
// react-router's <Link> is a fourth clickable element considered for this
// task (it needs router context Badge has no reason to depend on, so
// teaching Badge to render one directly would be real added machinery) —
// but both of this app's two actual <Link>-as-plain-text sites turned out
// NOT to want the Badge treatment on inspection: Dashboard.tsx's offsite-
// fault row link stays plain text (converting only the one clickable ROW
// STATE in an otherwise-plain-text list would make row height/typography
// jump depending on which domain is faulted — see that call site's own
// comment), and its "go to Recovery" nudge link instead adopted the app's
// existing primary-action button idiom directly (rule 3's one-solid-accent-
// action allowance, matching every other primary button already in the
// app — also documented at that call site). `badgeClassName` stays a
// private, non-exported helper for now: exporting a public escape hatch
// with zero real call sites is speculative API surface, not a needed one —
// if the same "must render as a router <Link>, but look like a Badge" need
// turns up at a genuine future site, exporting this one-line function is a
// one-line change.
//
// `wrap` — a stage's height is a fixed pixel floor for the common one-line
// case, but some call sites (the Dashboard protection-card badges: local
// verify shield / off-site subset / off-site DR, all icon+label+relative-
// time strings inside a narrow grid column) genuinely wrap to two lines in
// normal use, in the default locale, not just a translated-string edge case.
// A fixed `h-*` + `leading-none` painted the tinted background at exactly
// one line tall and let the wrapped second line spill outside it — the
// background box didn't grow with the content. `wrap` swaps the stage's
// `h-*` for `min-h-*` at the same px floor (so a single-line badge is
// unchanged), drops `leading-none` for readable multi-line spacing, and adds
// real vertical padding, so the box grows to contain however many lines the
// content needs instead of clipping at the stage's one-line floor.
//
// One consequence worth knowing: a fixed `h-*` is a DEFINITE cross size, which
// is what actually makes a stretch-aligned flex/grid parent leave the box at
// the stage's own height (`min-h-0` above is belt-and-braces). `wrap` trades
// that definite height for `min-h-*`, so a wrap badge sharing a flex line with
// a taller sibling WILL stretch to that line's height. Harmless where it is
// used today (a Dashboard wrap badge is the only thing in its grid cell, and
// OffsiteTargetsSection's two chips wrap onto separate flex lines before either
// grows), but a new call site that wants a short wrap badge to stay short next
// to a tall one needs `className="self-start"`.
//
// `inFlow` — the notch's LOOK without the notch's own POSITIONING, so a
// CALLER can position a whole GROUP of heading badges as one unit.
//
// History, because this replaced a much larger piece of machinery and the
// reasoning matters more than the diff: an earlier round built a SPLIT
// heading badge for the Recovery tab's step numbers — one pill, two cells,
// the leading one shaded and cut off from the label by a hard seam, driven by
// a `prefix` prop here, a `split` layout branch in badgeClassName, a
// `.glim-badge-prefix` rule in index.css and a whole
// --accent-contrast-inv/--item-hue-ink-inv token pair in accent.ts/
// appearance.ts whose only job was giving that shaded cell an ink to flip to.
// jdp reviewed it live and reversed it: "Die Cardtitelbadges mit Nummer
// sollen zwei getrennte Badges sein. Der Badge der Nummer nicht abgedunkelt."
// Two visually separate badges side by side, the number one taking the SAME
// plain fill as the name one — no seam, no shaded cell, no second colour.
// All of that machinery is therefore gone, not left dormant: `prefix`,
// `split`, `.glim-badge-prefix`, `--accent-contrast-inv` and
// `--item-hue-ink-inv` had exactly one consumer between them and it no longer
// exists. (Nothing else referenced the inv tokens — checked across src/ and
// index.css before deleting; the only reads were `.glim-badge-prefix`'s own
// `color:` and the four rainbow rebind blocks that fed it.)
//
// What the two-badge shape actually needs from this component is one thing:
// permission to NOT position itself. A heading notch normally carries its own
// `absolute top-0 -translate-y-1/2`, which is exactly right for the one-badge
// case and exactly wrong for two — two absolutely-positioned boxes with the
// same static position land on top of each other, and the obvious "just offset
// the second one" fix is a FIXED PIXEL OFFSET for this notch, which this
// codebase has already shipped and had to remove twice (see the REGRESSION
// note in badgeClassName below, and Settings.tsx's own offsite-tab history).
//
// `inFlow` moves the positioning up one level instead: the caller makes its
// `<h2>` the absolutely-positioned element and lays the badges out inside it
// with ordinary flexbox, so the pair's alignment to each other and to the
// card edge is solved by layout rather than by arithmetic. `-translate-y-1/2`
// on that h2 resolves against the H2's own rendered height — the tallest badge
// in the row — so the pair's vertical centre sits on the card edge at ANY
// badge height, and `items-center` puts both badges' own centres there too.
// A one-line pair and a pair whose name wrapped to two lines both straddle
// correctly with no height assumed anywhere. See StepCard.tsx, the one call
// site, for the concrete markup.
//
// Everything else the notch treatment gives a heading badge is UNCHANGED by
// this flag — the fixed `rounded-pill` radius, the `var(--elevation)` lift,
// `.glim-notch-hue` (so reactive mode's card-wide hover still reveals both
// badges), and `hueIndex`'s ordinary colour-engine participation. It removes
// the four positioning classes and nothing else. `insetStart` becomes
// meaningless alongside it (it is an override for the very offset that is no
// longer being emitted) and is ignored — the CALLER owns the horizontal
// position now, and the same static-position fallback that used to serve the
// badge serves the caller's h2 instead, RTL-correctly, for the same reason.
//
// `tone="heading"` / `size="heading"` (Task 5, rule 11 — "every heading is a
// filled section badge, never bare text... always coloured: it is a heading,
// not a control, so rule 9 [the three-way reactive colour mode] does not
// apply to it"). Colour choice:
//   - IS the full, solid `--accent` fill + `--accent-contrast` ink — the
//     EXACT SAME pairing this app already uses for a solid CTA elsewhere
//     (Sidebar.tsx's `navActive`, the "Speichern" button). REVISED from this
//     component's original rule-3-driven reasoning (rule 3 reserves solid
//     accent for ACTIVITY — "the active nav item, the single primary action,
//     progress fills... a page has at most one solid accent button" — and a
//     first pass read a Card heading as NOT activity, so it shipped a soft
//     `--accent-soft` wash instead, then an even-more-opaque `color-mix()`
//     of that same wash once the wash's own transparency became visible at
//     the notch's card-edge seam). jdp reviewed BOTH of those live and, on
//     the second round, said the notch still read as "abgedunkelt"
//     (darkened/dimmed) regardless of opacity — because a 14%-accent-into-
//     surface wash is inherently a pale, muted colour, full stop, whether
//     it's rendered with alpha or composited to a flat opaque equivalent of
//     the exact same pale colour. What was actually wanted is the real,
//     saturated accent colour, unmixed with anything — so this tone now
//     renders `bg-accent text-accentContrast` (see TONE_CLASSES below), and
//     `--accent-soft-solid` (the interim opaque-wash token from the prior
//     round) is gone from index.css entirely — nothing references it anymore.
//   - NOT any of the four state hues (ok/fail/warn/neutral): rule 4's hues
//     are load-bearing semantic signals elsewhere on the same pages these
//     headings live on (a container's running/settled/fault state, a
//     schedule's warning). Painting a heading "neutral" would borrow the
//     literal "waiting" state hue for a label that isn't waiting on
//     anything; painting it any of the other three invents a false status.
//     (This is specifically about rule 4's STATUS reading of neutral, on a
//     structural element that has no status. It doesn't conflict with
//     tone="neutral" being this same file's generic no-real-status default
//     for actual chips/badges elsewhere — see the TONE_CLASSES comment below
//     on the Task 7 "→ neutral" sites, which lands in that other,
//     pre-existing role instead.)
//   - REVISED AGAIN (jdp, second live-review round, emphatic): "Die ganzen
//     Toggle, Abschnittsbadges sind nicht in der Farbengine!! Im
//     Regenbogen-Modus hat alles die gleiche Farbe!" — every heading on a
//     rainbow-mode page WAS rendering the identical flat accent fill,
//     confirmed live against the real deployed container (Settings' seven
//     general-tab Card notches — Domänen/Sprache/Design/Akzentfarbe/Ecken/
//     Regenbogen-Modus/Leise Benachrichtigungen — all measured
//     rgb(252,196,25), the flat accent, with rainbow mode ON). The
//     paragraph below (kept for its still-correct "a heading isn't a
//     control" / rule-9 reasoning) argued headings should NEVER take a
//     rainbow position at all; jdp's live reaction overrides that specific
//     conclusion, not the reasoning about rule 3/rule 9 — a heading can
//     hold a rainbow POSITION (like any other list member) while still
//     being furniture rather than a control.
//
//     `hueIndex` (optional, below) is the opt-in this reversal needed:
//     omitted, a heading renders exactly as before (flat `bg-accent`,
//     unaffected by rainbow mode — correct for a genuine singleton heading,
//     the one-of-a-kind case design-language.md's rainbow section itself
//     carves out). Passed, the heading joins the rainbow the same way a
//     Selector segment or a ContainerRow does: `.glim-hue` +
//     `hueVars(rainbowAt(hueIndex))`, position assigned by the caller's own
//     LIST INDEX among the headings visible on that page/tab at once — a
//     page's several Card titles are exactly the "genuine equal-member set"
//     rule 2's "one hero, everything else quiet" was never meant to flatten
//     into a single shared colour; rule 2 governs the page's ONE <h1>, not
//     how many DIFFERENT hues its supporting section headings may carry.
//     Deliberately restricted to `tone === "heading"` only (see the Badge()
//     body below): every other tone is one of rule 4's four state hues, a
//     load-bearing status signal a stray `hueIndex` must never overwrite.
//     EXTENDED (offsite-tab card-split follow-up): `tone === "active"` now
//     qualifies too — see the `hueOn` computation in Badge()'s own body for
//     the full reasoning (it was never one of rule 4's four state hues to
//     begin with, the same reason this section's own history above gives
//     for why "active" replaced "info").
//   - Every heading gets a SOLID fill (not a translucent wash) either way —
//     flat accent when no `hueIndex` is given, its own rainbow position's
//     colour when one is. This does mean rule 3's "at most one solid accent
//     thing per page" no longer literally holds once a page has several
//     Cards — an accepted, deliberate consequence of this live-review
//     round's explicit ask, not an oversight: a heading badge is furniture
//     (rule 11 already exempts it from rule 9's reactive-colour treatment
//     for the same "not a control" reason), not a second competing call to
//     action, so several solid-accent HEADINGS on one page don't dilute the
//     page's one real primary-action button the way several solid-accent
//     BUTTONS would.
//   - Text is `text-accentContrast` (the computed black/white ink for
//     legibility ON TOP of a solid accent fill — see index.css's
//     `--accent-contrast` comment), not the previous quiet
//     `text-carbon-textSub`: that muted ink was chosen specifically for a
//     translucent wash where the card surface still dominated the contrast
//     ratio, a premise that no longer holds now the fill is fully opaque
//     accent.
//   - Sizing is a dedicated stage, not a reuse of `large` (the existing
//     tallest stage, already the visual weight of a real status/count chip —
//     ErrorDetailPanel's count badge, a "Resolve" button): giving headings
//     that SAME stage would make a passive section label compete pixel-for-
//     pixel with a genuine activity/status indicator for attention, exactly
//     backwards from what a heading should do. `heading`'s own stage keeps
//     the source uppercase+letter-spaced treatment the app's headings always
//     had (so this reads as an evolution of the existing convention, not a
//     wholesale redesign) with roomier padding sized for a title's worth of
//     text rather than a two-character status word.
//
// Deliberately NOT converted to this stage: a SECOND, nested heading level
// (an <h3>/<span> sub-label already living inside a Card/panel this stage
// already gave its own badge — e.g. Settings.tsx's "Export"/"Import"
// sub-headings inside the Settings I/O Card, OffsiteWizard's per-step
// labels inside its one wizard card). Badging every nesting level would
// stack multiple equally-loud badges inside one another and read as a wall
// of chips, not a hierarchy — rule 5 ("hierarchy from type and colour step")
// still applies one level down even though rule 11 exempts the outer
// heading from rule 9. Those sub-labels keep the plain eyebrow-style
// treatment on purpose; see each call site.
//
// (An earlier pass of this task filed Dashboard.tsx's SummaryCell labels
// here too — that was wrong. Each SummaryCell is its own standalone
// bg-carbon-surface rounded-card box, not nested inside anything already
// badged; it was actually a missed OUTERMOST heading and is now converted
// at its own call site, same as every other Card heading on that page.)
//
// RESOLVED (GlimStone follow-up pass, folded into v8.0.0): the ~7 modal
// dialog titles (Files.tsx, Fleet.tsx x2, Receiver.tsx, WhatsNewDialog.tsx,
// ConfirmDialog.tsx, ErrorDetailPanel.tsx) are now `tone="heading"
// size="heading"` Badges too. Rule 15 ("a window is a window... same
// surface, same radius, same elevation, title as a badge, button row at the
// bottom") is explicit about this: "title as a badge" is one clause in a
// list of concrete window-chrome requirements sitting alongside surface,
// radius and elevation — it is a prescription, not a placeholder for "figure
// this out later." It doesn't say WHICH badge, so this reuses rule 11's
// already-reasoned `tone="heading"`/`size="heading"` stage rather than
// inventing a second heading treatment the spec never asked for — a dialog
// title and a section heading are both "the name of the thing the reader is
// looking at," just at different scopes.
//
// Badge growing an `id` prop turned out unnecessary: the `<h2 id="…">`
// wrapper stays exactly where it was in the three sites that wire
// `aria-labelledby` to it (ConfirmDialog, WhatsNewDialog, ErrorDetailPanel)
// — only the h2's INNER content changed from bare text to `<Badge>`. An
// `aria-labelledby` reference resolves to the target element's computed
// text content, which still includes the Badge's rendered text regardless
// of the span nested inside it, so the accessible name is byte-identical to
// before. The other four dialogs (Files.tsx, Fleet.tsx x2, Receiver.tsx)
// name themselves via `aria-label` on the `role="dialog"` div directly, not
// via this heading at all, so there was nothing to preserve there either.
// Verified live in both themes with a screen reader against all 7 — see the
// PR/commit description for the accessibility-check writeup.
//
// Also deliberately NOT converted, and the only outermost <h2> in the app
// that stays bare text: an ALERT/CALLOUT heading whose panel is itself a
// filled status surface — today exactly one site, Dashboard.tsx's
// RecoveryNag (`bg-statusWarnBg` + `recovery.nagTitle`). Rule 11's "filled
// section badge" silently assumes a neutral card surface underneath for the
// fill to register against; a status callout has already spent that budget
// on its own background. Measured live at that site, at the time, against
// tone="heading"'s THEN-current accent-soft wash fill: accent-soft 1.06:1
// light / 1.39:1 dark, and warn-strong 1.00:1 light (index.css gives
// --status-warn-bg and --status-warn-bg-strong the same value in light mode)
// / 1.11:1 dark (numbers now superseded — a later live-review round replaced
// tone="heading"'s wash with a solid `bg-accent` fill, see this file's own
// tone="heading" section above — not re-measured against that fill, since
// RecoveryNag's heading stays plain either way and this site's own
// conclusion doesn't turn on the exact figure). So the badge would read as
// plain text with extra padding, while also
// discarding the text-statusWarn colour that currently carries the alert's
// meaning at 8.62:1. Left plain on purpose — this is a token gap, not an
// oversight, and the call site says so too. Every OTHER outermost heading
// in the app is a badge; if a future pass adds a real "badge on a status
// surface" tone pair, this is the one site waiting for it.
//
// RESOLVED, exempted (GlimStone follow-up pass, folded into v8.0.0): the 11
// page titles (the `<h1 text-2xl font-semibold>` at the top of each page,
// plus Recovery.tsx's `text-lg` one) were filed by the ORIGINAL Task 5 pass
// as "belongs to the same future rule-15 pass as the dialogs" — that framing
// doesn't survive actually reading rule 15's text. Rule 15 opens "A WINDOW
// is a window" and every clause under it (surface, radius, elevation, a
// button row at the bottom, an anchored title with only the middle region
// scrolling) describes MODAL chrome specifically — a floating, elevated
// card with its own button row. A page's root <h1> isn't inside a window by
// this app's own vocabulary (rule 1: `.glim-card` is the one elevation, and
// a page's own top-level content sits on the page ground, not raised); rule
// 15 has nothing to say about it either way.
//
// What DOES govern an <h1> is rule 2 ("one hero per page — exactly one
// element carries weight, everything else is supporting detail") plus the
// type scale's own explicit carve-out: "a page's one hero figure (rule 2) is
// sized on its own merits case by case, not from a repeated 'display' step —
// forcing every hero into one fixed size would fight the same rule that says
// there's exactly one hero and everything else is quiet." Each of these 11
// `<h1>`s IS that page's one hero (the single largest, heaviest text on the
// page, everything else — including every rule-11/rule-15 badge on the same
// page — deliberately quieter than it). Converting it to the SAME
// `tone="heading" size="heading"` Badge every section heading and dialog
// title now uses would make the page's one hero visually indistinguishable
// from the section badges nested underneath it, which is exactly the
// "everything else is quiet, exactly one thing carries weight" hierarchy
// rule 2 exists to protect — collapsing that hierarchy would be a rule-2
// regression dressed up as rule-15 compliance.
//
// So: NOT converted, and this is a considered exemption, not a re-deferral.
// All 11 stay exactly as they render today (`text-2xl font-semibold` /
// Recovery.tsx's `text-lg font-semibold` — already "sized on its own
// merits," per the type scale's own words, and already the loudest thing on
// each page). If a future page ever grows a genuinely bigger hero element
// (a stat figure, a chart headline) that outweighs its own <h1>, that page's
// <h1> would need re-examination on its own merits — but no page in this
// app has that shape today, so there's no live case to design against.

// tracks the shape engine's own --radius-control token, exactly like
// `rounded` below; kept as its own named value purely so a call site reads
// as "this is a square icon tile" rather than "this is a rounded text chip",
// not because the two resolve to different CSS), circle (pill radius again
// but width locked to height, for icon-only/single-glyph badges — same
// radius as pill, distinct semantic use). Deliberately NOT the percentage-
// capped `min(var(--radius-pill), 50%)` formula: a CSS percentage
// border-radius resolves per-axis into an ellipse, not a stadium, so the
// plain length-based `rounded-pill` token (which already auto-scales
// correctly against this component's own fixed per-stage heights) is used
// as-is, with zero cap needed.
//
// FIXED (GlimStone follow-up round, jdp's live review of the off-site tab's
// four square icon badges — "nicht in der Formengine... die sind falsch
// eingefärbt"): `square` used to hard-code `rounded-none` (literal 0px
// corners, ALWAYS, in every shape-engine mode) — see RADIUS_CLASSES below.
// That was a real shape-engine miss, the SAME mistake pattern as if a
// Selector or any other control ignored `--radius-control`: with the app's
// shape engine set to "soft" or "round", these four badges stayed hard
// square instead of picking up the user's own chosen corner roundness,
// because the doc comment above (kept, now corrected) conflated "this
// component's own shape option named square" with "the global shape
// engine's square PRESET" and hard-coded the latter's value (0) instead of
// reading the engine's live token. Fixed by pointing `square` at the exact
// same `rounded-control` class `rounded` already uses — a square-aspect
// badge now renders 0 corners in "square" mode, genuinely rounded corners in
// "soft"/"round" mode, verified live with getComputedStyle against all three
// shape-engine settings.

// explicit left/right/start/end offset" comment inside badgeClassName below
// for the full mechanism, and each of those five files' own git history for
// the specific incident. Short version: the notch's horizontal position was
// ALWAYS derived from the CSS static-position fallback (no left/start ever
// set), which is only correct when the badge's `<h2>` is a normal-flow child
// of the SAME padded box that holds the card's visible content. The moment a
// card's `relative` positioned ancestor and its padded content box are two
// DIFFERENT elements — needed whenever the content box also carries its own
// `overflow-hidden` (so the badge's own -11px poke isn't clipped by it; see
// Card()'s own comment in Dashboard.tsx) — the static position silently
// stops matching the content padding and falls back to the OUTER box's own
// (zero) padding instead: flush with the card's bare edge, not its content.
// Every one of those five incidents is the identical structural mismatch,
// discovered independently, at a different call site, in a different round,
// because nothing about the mechanism made the dependency visible — a
// call site could get this right or wrong purely as a side effect of which
// of two structurally-identical-looking div arrangements it happened to use.
//
// `insetStart` is the fix at the mechanism, not another per-call-site patch:
// an EXPLICIT step on the Tailwind spacing scale, passed by the caller,
// that a card whose padded content box is a p-4/p-5/p-6 box the badge's own
// `relative` ancestor does NOT share must pass — matching that content box's
// own padding step number literally. Once passed, the notch's horizontal
// position no longer depends on which of the two structural recipes (single
// merged div vs. split outer/inner) the card happens to use; it is stated
// once, directly, at the one call site that actually knows the number,
// instead of being re-derived by the browser from ambient DOM shape. A card
// using the single-merged-div recipe (the large majority — Settings.tsx's
// Card(), Config.tsx's own two Cards, Containers.tsx/VMs.tsx's panels,
// Files.tsx/Fleet.tsx/Receiver.tsx's empty-state cards, and more) still omits
// this prop entirely and keeps relying on the static-position fallback, which
// is the CORRECT mechanism for that recipe (see the long comment below) — this
// is an opt-in override for the one recipe shape that structurally can't use
// the fallback correctly, not a replacement for it everywhere.
//
// Only 4/5/6 are enumerated (not an arbitrary number) because those are the
// only content-box padding steps any split-recipe Card in this app has ever
// used — Tailwind v4's utility classes must appear as literal strings in
// source for the JIT scanner to generate them (no `start-${n}` string
// interpolation), so this is a closed lookup table, extended the same way
// SIZE_TOKENS/RADIUS_CLASSES above are whenever a new literal value is
// genuinely needed, not a general-purpose arbitrary-value escape hatch.

// such cap, it reads at the same visual weight as an ok/fail/warn chip

  // 22px case (`h-[22px]` in SIZE_TOKENS.heading above) resolves to the
  // identical -11px this used to hard-code, so nothing changes there.
  //
  // REGRESSION this replaces (live-review round, jdp: "Im Dashboard sind
  // viele Cardtitelbadges nicht richtig platziert" — Dashboard.tsx's
  // SummaryTier, the one narrow sm:grid-cols-3 cell already flagged below as
  // wrapping "in the DEFAULT locale too"): the previous fixed `-top-[11px]`
  // was ALWAYS exactly half of the SINGLE-LINE 22px case, never recomputed
  // for a wrapped badge's real (taller) height. That was fine the day it
  // shipped — checked against this app's longest heading strings across all
  // 26 locales, "short section-title phrases that fit on one line... except
  // the one narrow sm:grid-cols-3 cell" — but "fits at 1440px" quietly became
  // "wraps to 2 lines" at any ordinary laptop/half-screen width once that one
  // cell's own 3-way split narrows enough (measured live: ~640-850px, three
  // SummaryCells sharing a row, German "NÄCHSTES BACKUP"/"LETZTES ERGEBNIS"
  // — not a locale/string-length edge case, an ordinary browser width one).
  // A wrapped badge is ~34px tall, not 22px; poking from a FIXED -11px then
  // put its far edge at +23px into the card (double the intended overlap)
  // instead of the intended +17px half — enough to visually bury the card's
  // own first content line (confirmed live: "OK Ordner" nearly fully hidden
  // under "LETZTES ERGEBNIS"). This is the SAME failure family Settings.tsx's
  // own offsite-tab history already hit once from the opposite direction (a
  // zero-height heading + a fixed gap, two 22px notches landing on top of
  // each other, see that file's own comment) — a fixed pixel offset derived
  // from ONE assumed height, silently wrong the moment the real height
  // isn't that one value. `-translate-y-1/2` is the general fix for the
  // whole family: it needs no assumed height at all, single-line or wrapped.
  //
  // No explicit left/right/start/end offset BY DEFAULT (insetStart omitted):
  // with both left and right left `auto`, an absolutely positioned box falls
  // back to its CSS "static position" — where it would have rendered had
  // position stayed static. Every call site wraps Badge in a `flex
  // items-center` <h2> (or, per this project's RTL-positioning convention —
  // see FilterPopover.tsx and Settings.tsx's dropdown menu — the logical
  // `start`/`end` pair is how this app expresses direction-aware offsets
  // elsewhere), so the static position is the flex container's own start
  // edge: it inherits whichever padding the real call site's card already
  // uses (p-5 here, p-4 there, zero on a few bare group-label headings, or
  // wherever a heading sits deeper in a decorated row — StepCard.tsx's
  // numbered-circle row, for one) with zero per-call-site horizontal class
  // needed, AND it is automatically RTL-correct (a flex row's start edge is
  // the row's RIGHT edge under dir="rtl") for the same zero-extra-classes
  // reason — the static-position fallback is direction-aware by definition.
  // CORRECT precisely when the `<h2>` is a normal-flow child of the SAME
  // padded box that holds the card's visible content — every single-merged-
  // div Card in this app that ALSO stretches its `<h2>` full-width (Settings.tsx's
  // Card(), Config.tsx's own two Cards, Containers.tsx/VMs.tsx's panels, and
  // more) has exactly that shape, so this fallback is still the right,
  // self-maintaining mechanism for all of those — no insetStart needed, and
  // none should be added.
  //
  // WRONG — silently — in (at least) two distinct ways, neither visible from
  // reading the call site's own JSX in isolation:
  //
  // (1) The card's `relative` positioned ancestor and its padded content box
  // are two DIFFERENT elements: the static position then measures against the
  // OUTER (unpadded) box instead of the content box's own padding, landing
  // the badge flush with the card's bare edge instead of its content. That
  // split shape is sometimes structurally required (a content box that is
  // ALSO `overflow-hidden`, to clip ProgressBar's square-ended bar to the
  // card's rounded corners, would clip the badge's own -11px poke above it if
  // the badge lived inside that same box — so the badge has to move to an
  // outer, unclipped ancestor instead). This exact mismatch independently bit
  // Dashboard.tsx's Card() AND SummaryCell(), ActivityLog.tsx, Flash.tsx's
  // and Config.tsx's backup Cards.
  //
  // (2) The card IS a single merged div (no split), but its OWN layout
  // recipe centers its body content (`text-center flex flex-col
  // items-center` — an empty-state pitch: icon, paragraph, button, all
  // centered). Once the notch Badge inside the `<h2>` becomes
  // `position: absolute`, it stops contributing to the h2's own intrinsic
  // size — an h2 with nothing else in flow collapses to a 0×0 box, which the
  // parent's `items-center` then centers horizontally in the card instead of
  // stretching it to the padding edge. The static position resolves against
  // that zero-width, CENTERED h2, landing the badge at the card's horizontal
  // MIDDLE, not its content edge. Bit Files.tsx's, Fleet.tsx's and
  // Receiver.tsx's identical empty-state Cards identically.
  //
  // Eight separate discoveries total, across eight separate live-review
  // rounds, of two different defects with the identical SYMPTOM (badge not
  // flush with content) and the identical ROOT CAUSE SHAPE (the notch's
  // horizontal position is a function of ambient DOM/CSS structure the call
  // site never states explicitly) — because nothing about "no offset =
  // inherit ambient padding" made that dependency visible at the call site,
  // for either variant. `insetStart` (NotchInset, above) is the fix for BOTH:
  // an EXPLICIT step on the Tailwind spacing scale, matching the card's own
  // content-box padding literally, passed by any call site whose structural
  // recipe can't rely on the static-position fallback's assumptions (whichever
  // of the two ways it can't). Once passed, it renders as a real `start-N`
  // class below — a real CSS offset resolved directly against the `relative`

  // latest live review replaced both with the plain, full-strength
  // TONE_CLASSES.heading fill below). A heading-toned badge renders the
  // identical solid accent fill whether or not it's also the notch size.
  //
  // isIconOnly && tone==="active" is the one exception to reusing
  // TONE_CLASSES verbatim.
  //
  // ROUND 1 (GlimStone follow-up round, jdp's live review of the converted
  // off-site buttons, emphatic and specific: "Die Buttons ... haben farbige
  // Schrift" — the coloured TEXT itself, not the tinted background wash, was
  // the complaint). A text badge's `text-accentText` ink is only legible
  // BECAUSE it carries the hue — there is no text left to read once the
  // content is a bare glyph, so that reasoning no longer applies, and
  // design-language's own established "icons carry no colour of their own,
  // only the badge does" rule (already the reason IconAdd/IconTrash render
  // `currentColor` inside a plain `text-carbon-textSub` button, Settings.tsx's
  // Registries card) took over instead: `text-carbon-textSub`, the same
  // neutral ink every other icon-only badge in the app already reads its
  // glyph colour from — riding on the UNCHANGED hued `bg-accentSoft` wash
  // underneath it.
  //
  // ROUND 2, THIS FIX (jdp's next live-review round, on those same four
  // badges: "die sind falsch eingefärbt, so halb abgedunkelt, das soll nicht
  // so sein"): `bg-accentSoft` IS a 14%-alpha wash (`--accent-soft: rgba(...,
  // 0.14)`/`--item-hue-soft` — see index.css/appearance.ts) — the EXACT same
  // "half-darkened" failure mode this file's own tone="heading" section
  // documents fixing once already (a translucent accent-into-surface wash
  // reads as pale/dimmed no matter its alpha, full stop). Round 1 only ever
  // touched the TEXT colour and explicitly left "the wash stays" — but the
  // wash was the actual bug jdp is now naming directly. Fixed the same way:
  // drop the wash, use the full solid `bg-accent` fill instead — which,
  // exactly like tone="heading", now needs a computed-contrast ink rather
  // than a flat neutral one (`text-carbon-textSub` was only ever safe against
  // a PALE 14%-wash background; measured live against the RAINBOW palette's
  // own solid hues once the fill went opaque, several dropped to ~1.0–1.8:1
  // in dark theme and ~2.5–4.9:1 in light theme — a real contrast failure,
  // the identical premise-no-longer-holds reasoning tone="heading" already
  // gives for why IT moved off `text-carbon-textSub` onto `text-accentContrast`
  // when ITS fill went from wash to solid). `text-accentContrast` is still a
  // NEUTRAL ink in the sense the design-language rule actually cares about —
  // computed black/white (`contrastOn()`/`--item-hue-ink`), carrying no hue of
  // its own — it only stops being the specific token `text-carbon-textSub`,
  // which was tuned for a pale wash background this badge no longer has.
  // Every other tone/isIconOnly combination (a text chip, or an icon-only
  // badge of any OTHER tone — none exist live today, but nothing here assumes
