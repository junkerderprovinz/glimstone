// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ConfirmDialog — the GlimStone styled confirmation dialog (form-engine
// Task 7), replacing every window.confirm() call site in the app.
//
// Extracted from the SAME modal chrome already used by WhatsNewDialog.tsx and
// ErrorDetailPanel.tsx: rounded-card bg-carbon-surface, an anchored header
// (title + close X), a scrolling middle (the actual per-call-site message —
// same copy every call site already passed to window.confirm(), this task
// swaps the MECHANISM only, never the copy), an anchored footer (Cancel +
// Confirm). Backdrop-click/the header X/the footer Cancel button all resolve
// to the same onCancel. Escape and the Tab focus-trap are NOT handled here —
// see lib/useConfirm.tsx's header comment for why (a real modal needs both to
// work even when focus has left the dialog's own DOM subtree, which a React
// `onKeyDown` on this root can never observe).
//
// Pure, hookless function component on purpose — same shape as Toggle.tsx/
// Badge.tsx/RevealInput.tsx (props in, an element tree out) — so it stays
// unit-testable by calling it directly with props, no renderer/jsdom needed
// (see Toggle.test.ts's header comment: this repo's test suite is
// `environment: "node"` with zero DOM-rendering infrastructure — `document`
// itself is undefined there, which is also why the createPortal(...,
// document.body) call that makes this dialog genuinely modal lives in
// useConfirm.tsx instead of here: this component never touches `document`).
// The STATEFUL half (the pending-request queue, the promise plumbing, the
// portal, Escape, the focus trap, and returning focus to the trigger on
// close) lives in the companion hook, lib/useConfirm.tsx — mirrors
// useReveal.ts/RevealInput.tsx's split, extended to cover real modality.
//
// `ref` is a plain prop here (React 19 — function components accept `ref`
// without forwardRef): useConfirm.tsx attaches it to the dialog card so it
// can find the card's focusable elements for the Tab trap and query
// `document.activeElement` against it. Passing it through a plain function
// call in a test (as this file's own tests do) is inert — React only treats
// `ref` specially on a JSX-created host element, not on the props object a
// hand-written test builds, and no test here exercises it.
