// Toggle — the one shared switch control (GlimStone form-engine Task 4).
//
// Replaces three previously-separate copies of the same track+thumb button:
// IncludeToggle's inline switch, Settings.tsx's ToggleRow switch (reused by
// Config.tsx and Recovery.tsx), and OffsiteTargetsSection's inline fourth
// copy. All three drift risk is now in one place.
//
// The focus ring is `--focus-ring`, NOT the `outline-statusInfoSolid` blue every
// one of those three copies carried. Two reasons, both only visible ACROSS tasks:
//   - Task 1's own plan note about `--status-info-solid` — whose hue was then
//     still deliberately unresolved (audit item 19, deferred to Phase 2) — was
//     "just don't add MORE dependencies on it." A new shared component is
//     precisely a new dependency, and the single point through which a later
//     hue change would reach every switch in the app at once. Phase 2 Task 7
//     has since resolved it: `--status-info-solid` no longer exists at all
//     (see index.css's TASK 7 comment for what every real call site became) —
//     this comment stays as the historical reason THIS component never took
//     the dependency in the first place, not a forward-looking warning anymore.
//   - `--focus-ring` is already what the other shared controls this branch added
//     or reworked use: RevealInput's eye, InfoBubble's icon, Toast's dismiss X.
//     A switch focusing blue while the reveal eye in the same form focuses amber
//     reads as two unrelated systems rather than one.
// `outline-offset-2` keeps the ring on the surrounding card surface rather than
// on the track's own fill — that surface is the background `--focus-ring`'s
// contrast was actually measured against (see index.css; ≥3:1 on both
// --carbon-surface and --carbon-surface2, in both themes).
//
// `hideLabel` is the GlimStone "Switches" contract verbatim: the text always
// survives as the control's accessible name (`aria-label`, set unconditionally
// so a switch is never nameless) — hideLabel only decides whether the eye
// ALSO sees it as visible text next to the track. There is no "indent" prop:
// per the design language's "flush, no indent" rule, indentation of a
// sub-switch is a caller-side layout concern (padding on the wrapping
// container), never something the switch itself renders.

          // RTL (flex main-start follows `direction`), so the thumb's
          // untransformed rest position already flips to the right edge —
          // but the physical translate then pushes it EVEN FURTHER right on

          // sign so the shift lands on the correct side of the now-mirrored
          // base position either way (RTL sweep, form-engine Phase 2 Task 6
          // follow-up fix). The `!` on the override isn't stylistic — both
          // classes set the same single `translate` property with equal
          // selector specificity, so without it the winner would depend on
          // Tailwind's generated declaration order rather than being
          // guaranteed by the cascade.
          //
          // INVARIANT this relies on: the `rtl:` variant resolves against the
          // PAGE (its compiled selector is an inherited-`:lang()` list OR
          // `[dir=rtl] *`), while the flex base position it corrects resolves
          // against the nearest `dir` ANCESTOR. Those agree everywhere today,
          // but they would diverge if a call site ever nested a Toggle inside
          // its own `dir="ltr"`/`dir="rtl"` island — the base would mirror one
          // way and the sign flip the other, putting the thumb outside its
          // track again. RevealInput hit exactly that (see its header comment)
          // via OffsiteWizard's `<label dir="ltr">`; there the fix was to make
          // BOTH halves page-gated. Here there is nothing to make page-gated —
          // flex direction is not overridable per-property — so the rule is
          // simply: do not put a Toggle inside a dir-overriding container.

          // the literal), never a container that also holds layout.

          // `--radius-control` (index.css's other candidate, used by cards/
          // buttons/fields): (1) consistency — the track and its own thumb
          // reading the same variable is what makes them read as one control
          // reshaping together, not two independently-tuned pieces that
          // happen to move in the same direction; (2) the actual numbers only
          // work out right with --radius-pill. At shape="round", --radius-pill
          // is 9999px — on this 14px (h-3.5 w-3.5) box that still resolves to
          // a perfect circle (any radius ≥ half the box side does), matching
          // "round shape → circular knob (current, unchanged)" exactly.
