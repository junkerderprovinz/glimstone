// Carrying a rainbow position across a portal boundary ([543]).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The rainbow engine works by inheritance: `[data-rainbow] .glim-hue` (index.css)
// redefines `--color-accent` and friends for its whole SUBTREE, so anything
// painted with `var(--accent)` inside a card takes THAT card's palette position
// with no per-call-site wiring. That is the mechanism half this codebase relies
// on, and several comments cite it as the reason they need no `hueIndex` prop.
//
// A portal breaks it, silently. `createPortal` moves the DOM node to <body>,
// where there is no `.glim-hue` ancestor left, so every hued colour inside it
// falls back to the single global accent. Nothing errors, nothing looks broken
// in isolation, and the panel simply wears the wrong colour — which is only
// visible next to the control that opened it.
//
// This happened twice. DropdownListbox.tsx solved it for its own panel and
// wrote down exactly why ("portalling without this would have silently dropped
// them back to the single global accent, which is exactly the regression that
// rule exists to prevent"). Then [478] portalled FolderBrowser's dialog and did
// not apply it, so a folder dialog opened from a card tinted #FF8389 painted
// its one accent control #BE95FF, the global default. Measured live, not
// guessed. That is the `guard-applied-once-is-a-guard-missing-twice` shape, and
// the fix for the SECOND occurrence is to stop having two copies rather than to
// make a third.
//
// The property list is DERIVED from `hueVars()` rather than typed out. The
// original list carried the note "kept in step with it by hand, the same way
// index.css's rules that consume these names are" — an honest description of a
// list that goes stale the first time a token is added, and one token was in
// fact removed from hueVars() since. Reading the keys off the function that
// writes them cannot drift.

 * Copy the trigger's rainbow position onto a portalled panel.
 *
 * Read off the trigger's *resolved* computed style rather than taken as a prop,
 * so it needs nothing from the call sites and keeps working for any future one:
 * whatever hue the trigger stands in, the panel it opens stands in too.
 *
 * `.glim-hue` travels with the properties because index.css's own
 * `[data-rainbow] .glim-hue` and `[data-rainbow="reactive"] .glim-hue:hover`
 * rules do the actual `--accent` derivation. Applying the class here rather
 * than deriving colours means every rainbow MODE keeps working, instead of this
 * hook hard-coding one mode's answer.
 *
 * With rainbow off there are no `--item-hue*` values to copy, `style` stays
 * undefined and `className` empty, and the panel keeps the global accent
 * exactly as before. The class is never applied without the properties: as
 * appearance.ts puts it, "`.glim-hue` with no `--item-hue` under it would
 * resolve the accent to nothing".
