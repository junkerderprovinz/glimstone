 * The same promise, for a picker that is NOT a native <select>.
 *
 * Rule 18 says a native control gets replaced rather than persuaded, and an app
 * that follows it ends up with no <select> left for the function above to reach.
 * The behaviour must not be lost on the way: jdp, about an app that had just
 * finished replacing its last one, "Dropdownlisten soll man ueberall auch per
 * scrollen umschalten koennen." So the wheel belongs to the PICKER, not to the
 * element the platform happens to draw.
 *
 * Attach it to the trigger - the button that opens the list - and return the
 * detach. `step` receives 1 for a wheel roll downwards and -1 for one upwards;
 * the caller clamps at both ends, because a picker that wraps from the last
 * value to the first turns one notch too many into a value from the other end of
 * the list.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A LISTENER AND NOT AN onWheel PROP, which is the part worth
 * knowing before somebody simplifies it away: React registers `onWheel` as a
 * PASSIVE listener on its root, so `preventDefault` inside such a handler does
 * nothing but log a warning. The page would scroll while the value changed,
 * which is the one behaviour this feature exists to avoid. A listener attached
 * to the node with `{ passive: false }` is the only version that works, in every
 * framework and in none.
