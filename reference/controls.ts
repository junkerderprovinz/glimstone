// How much of a control's identity is shown: its text, its glyph, or both.
//
// This is the label engine. Like the shape and motion engines it turns one
// setting into attributes on the document root, and every component picks the
// answer up from CSS it already reads — nothing downstream is told about the
// change, and no component decides for itself what "glyph mode" means.
//
// This file stays free of any UI framework on purpose: it's the piece an
// adopting app copies wholesale, and a design language shouldn't arrive with a
// framework attached. A React app wraps it in a small hook; anything else calls
// the functions directly.

/**
 * The four modes.
 *
 * 'text'      — label only, no glyph.
 * 'textGlyph' — glyph beside the label. The default, because it is what an app
 *               looks like before the setting exists, and nobody's interface
 *               should change merely because a preference was added.
 * 'glyph'     — glyph only. The label survives as the accessible name and as
 *               the hover bubble, never as nothing.
 * 'reactive'  — glyph only at rest, words returning on hover and on focus.
 *
 * Why 'reactive' can exist at all, and why it is last: it costs no layout.
 * Every control already reserves its LABEL's width in glyph mode (see the
 * width stages below), so the box is wide enough for the words before they
 * arrive, and revealing them moves nothing on the page. Without the stages
 * this mode would reflow the interface under the pointer, which is the exact
 * thing the stages exist to prevent — build them first, or don't offer this
 * mode.

// Width stages
//
// The requirement that makes this engine usable: a control keeps the SAME

// therefore cannot come from what is currently rendered — a lone glyph is
// narrow — it has to come from the LABEL, which is present in every mode even
// when it is only the accessible name.
//
// Why stages rather than each control measuring its own text: measurement
// happens in the browser, after layout, which is both untestable and a source
// of jitter. A stage is a pure function of the label, known before first
// paint, and it gives the tidy aligned look that a mixed set of hand-measured
// widths does not.
//
// Why the CURRENT language decides the stage, measured rather than assumed:
// across a large locale set the same label grows by up to 3.4x ("Clear"
// becomes "Kijelölés törlése" in Hungarian, "Show" becomes "Megjelenítés").
// Pinning one global stage per control would make every English and Chinese
// interface pay for the longest translation, permanently. Deriving the stage
// from the active language keeps each language tidy on its own terms, and the
// width then changes when the LANGUAGE changes — a reload-level event, not
// something that happens while someone is looking at a mode selector.
